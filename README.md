# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Michael Tanjuakio**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Hulu with Turtles** is a Hulu app clone but with a twist! It's filled with turtles and turtle content only.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üê¢üåäüòÜ**

## Original App Layout (Optional Stretch Feature)

Here is my entry for the "Create a second layout, this time for an original, personal app idea" stretch feature:

It is for an app that **would have online shopping in your nearby markets!**.

I didn't make one. But that's what the app would be.

## Notes

Learning XML was tough. It took me a bit of adjusting to get used to the layouts, the textviews, and buttons. 
This was a good experience and it surely helped me in my Android learning journey.
